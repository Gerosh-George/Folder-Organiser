# Folder-Organiser
A simple python script to organise your folder with a single command.

Note: You can add your own extensions in the dictionary according to the files that you work with on daily basis.

This code is for windows where BAT file is used to run the command.

On MacOS you can use shellscript to obtain the same result. The syntax will be little different.
